This project is a small Bulgarian-language news aggregator website. It's a platform that gathers the most interesting news from top Bulgarian news websites.
It's a purely toy-project I worked on in my spare time with no commercial purposes. It was made with the idea to practice building something with Flask and web scraping.
I do read a lot of news, so instead of hopping from website to website I just gather it in one place here. The code that scrapes the data is
in a separate project.

The website is currently hosted on a popular cloud platform using a free plan so performance might not always be stellar. But generally it seems ok.
I'm also thinking of adding some features in the near future. 

Technologies used - Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap
